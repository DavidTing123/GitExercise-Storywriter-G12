Lazy John,"There was a boy named John who was so lazy he couldn t even change his clothes. One day, he saw the apple tree in their yard was full of fruits. He wanted to eat some apples, but he was too lazy to climb the tree and take the fruits. So he lay down underneath the tree and waited for the fruits to fall off. John waited until he was starving, but the apples never fell.

Moral of the story:

Laziness can get you nowhere. If you want something, you need to work hard for it."
The Fox and The Grapes,"Once, there was a hungry fox who stumbled upon a vineyard. After seeing the round, juicy grapes hanging in a bunch, the fox drooled. But no matter how high he jumped, he couldn t reach for it. So he told himself that it was probably sour and left. That night, he had to sleep on an empty stomach.

Moral of the Story:

Most of us tend to act like the fox. When we want something but think it s too hard to attain, we make excuses. We tell ourselves that it s probably not that great instead of working hard for it."
The Hare and the Tortoise,"There was once a hare who was friends with a tortoise. One day, he challenged the tortoise to a race. Seeing how slow the tortoise was going, the hare thought he d win this easily. So, he took a nap while the tortoise kept on going. When the hare woke, he saw that the tortoise was already at the finish line. Much to his chagrin, the tortoise won the race while he was busy sleeping.

Moral of the story:

There are a couple of moral lessons we can learn from this story. The hare teaches that overconfidence can sometimes ruin you. While the tortoise teaches us about the power of perseverance. Even if all the odds are stacked against you, never give up. Sometimes, life is not about who s the fastest or the strongest; it s about who is the most consistent."
The Dog and the Bone,"Once, there was a dog who wandered the streets night and day in search of food. One day, he found a big juicy bone, and he immediately grabbed it in his mouth and took it home. On his way home, he crossed a river and saw another dog with a bone in its mouth. He wanted that bone for himself, too. But as he opened his mouth, the bone he was biting fell into the river and sank. That night, he went home hungry.

Moral of the story:

If we always envy others, we ll lose what we already have, just like the greedy dog."
The Thirsty Crow,"After flying a long distance, a thirsty crow wandered the forest searching for water. Finally, he saw a pot half-filled with water. He tried to drink from it, but his beak wasn t long enough to reach the water inside. He then saw pebbles on the ground, and one by one, he put them in the pot until the water rose to the brim. The crow then hastily drank from it and quenched his thirst.

Moral of the story:

If there s a will, there s a way. Every problem has a solution if we look hard and don t give up."
The Ant and The Grasshopper,"The ant and the grasshopper were good friends. In the summer, the ant works hard to fill his storage with food. While the grasshopper was enjoying the fine weather and playing all day. 

When winter came, the ant was lying cozily in his home, surrounded by the food he stored during the summer. While the grasshopper was in his home, hungry and freezing. He asked the ant for food, and the ant gave him some. But it wasn t enough to last the entire winter. When he tried to ask the ant again, the latter replied:  I m sorry my friend but my food is just enough for my family to last until the end of winter. If I give you more, we too will starve. We had the entire summer to prepare for the winter but you chose to play instead. 

Moral of the story:

Winter, in this story, represents a time in our lives when food and resources are scarce. Summer is that time when everything is abundant. So, if you have a lot right now, save some of it for the winter."
The Boy Who Cried Wolf,"There was once a shepherd boy who liked to play tricks. One day, while he was watching over the herd, the boy decided to play a trick and cried,  wolf! wolf! . The people who heard rushed over to help him. But they were disappointed when they saw no wolf, and the boy laughed at them. The next day, he did it again, and people rushed to his aid, only to be disappointed again. 

On the third day, the boy saw a wolf devouring one of his sheep and cried for help. But the people who heard him thought this was just another of the boy s pranks, so no one came to help him. That day, the boy lost some of his sheep to the wolf.

Moral of the story:

If you always lie and cheat on other people, there will come a time when no one will believe you anymore."
